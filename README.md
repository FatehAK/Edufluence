### Tech Stack
* HTML, CSS, Javascript (ES6)
* Node.js Backend
* Socket.io for signaling
* Netlify for hosting

### Why WebRTC ?
WebRTC is a cutting edge serverless technology allows browsers(or peers) to talk to each other and transmit data directly without the need for a centralized server, ensuring maximum security. WebRTC makes it possible to establish peer-to-peer connectivity to other web browsers easily. 

Traditionally, building such an application from scratch requires a number of frameworks and libraries that deal with typical issues like packet loss, connection dropping, and NAT traversal. With WebRTC, all of this comes built-in into the browser by default. There is isnâ€™t any need for plugins or third-party software, hence assisting in development.

### Features
* Real time 1:1 audio/video p2p streaming.
* Send messages directly with privacy guarantees.
* File sharing with chunking to speed up transfer and ensure reliability.
* Screen sharing (full screen or tabs) for a great learning experience.
* A/V controls to pause/unpause video or mute/unmute audio.
* Fully responsive and can be used on mobile devices as well.

### Local Development
To get started developing right away:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `node server.js`
* The dev server should be running at `localhost:3000`
